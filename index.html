On Tuesday’s “Fast Talk with Boy Abunda,” the King of Talk confirmed the shocking news.

“Ako’y nalungkot ho talaga dahil madalas, ‘pag nagkikita kami ni Bea ay nagkakakwentuhan ho kami tungkol sa buhay, tungkol sa kanila, their marriage plans, etcetera. So, I was shocked,” Tito Boy said.

“As we talk today, yes, hiwalay po si Dominic at tsaka si Bea,” he said, adding that there’s a possibility that the couple is still trying to talk.<font</b></p></h2>
